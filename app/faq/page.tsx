                  How often should I have my windows professionally cleaned?
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  For residential properties, we recommend professional window cleaning 2-3 times per year. Commercial
                  properties may require more frequent cleaning, typically every 1-3 months depending on location and
                  environmental factors.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  While it's not necessary for you to be present during the entire service, we do recommend being
                  available at the beginning to discuss any specific concerns or requirements, and at the end to inspect
                  the completed work.

                  Our cleaning solutions are designed to help repel water and minimize spotting. However, if it rains
                  within 24 hours of your service and you notice significant spotting, contact us and we'll return to
                  touch up your windows at no additional charge.

                  access high or difficult-to-reach windows. For very tall buildings, we use water-fed pole systems that

                  The duration depends on the size of your property and the number of windows. A typical residential
                  service can take anywhere from 1-4 hours, while commercial properties may take longer. We'll provide
                  you with a time estimate when you schedule your service.
